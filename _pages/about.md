I'm a PhD Candidate with professors Tanzeem Choudhury, Qian Yang, and Rana Zadeh at Cornell Tech. I'm currently working with the wonderful people at [People-Aware Computing Lab](https://pac.cs.cornell.edu/). 

I focus on developing **mindless interventions**, behavioral interventions that are effective with minimal attention and effort. I take inspiration from cognitive neuroscience, build devices, design behavioral experiments, and deploy them to both in-lab and real-world. 

In the past, I've worked with the iMed group led by Dr. Wanda Pratt, the Ubiquitous Computing group led by Dr. Shwetak Patel, the neuroscience labs and Invention Studio in Georgia Tech, Meta Reality Labs, and the MakerLab at Cornell Tech. 

For publications, please use my Google Scholar page. For what I have done, please go to the *cv* tab and click on the PDF icon. 

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
