I'm a PhD Candidate with Dr. Tanzeem Choudhury at Cornell Tech. I'm currently working with the wonderful people at [People-Aware Computing Lab](https://pac.cs.cornell.edu/). 

I focus on developing **mindless interventions** that can facilitate emotion regulation with minimal attention from the users. I take inspirations from cognitive neuroscience, build devices, design behavioral experiments, and deploy! 

In the past, I've worked with the iMed group led by Dr. Wanda Pratt, the Ubiquitous Computing group led by Dr. Shwetak Patel, the neuroscience-y labs and Invention Studio in Georgia Tech, and Meta Reality Labs. 

This page is under re-construction :(. For publications, please use my Google Scholar page. For what I've done, please go to the *cv* tab and click on the PDF icon. 

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
